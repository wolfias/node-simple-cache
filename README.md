node-simple-cache
=================

A simple cache module for Node.JS than lets you switch easily between cache systems (file, memcached, redis, couchDB, etc).

It is a bit inspired by PHP module Cache::Lite, and on all the experience I had in having to use different types of caches in different applications.

This is a Work in Progress, I'll commit the first version that let's you use at least file and memcached.
