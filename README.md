node-simple-cache
=================

A simple cache module for Node.JS than lets you switch easily between cache systems (file, memcached, redis, couchDB, etc).

It is a bit inspired by PHP module Cache::Lite, and on all the experience I had in having to use different types of caches in different applications.
